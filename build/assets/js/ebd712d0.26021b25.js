Ensure that this tab is accurate and up-to-date so that your G2 product profile page is professional, consistent, and informative for potential buyers. ## Product logos The Product Logos section is where you can brand your product with the appropriate logos for both your G2 product profile page and your product\u2019s potential inclusion in a G2 Grid. ### Profile logo The profile logo appears at the top of your G2 product profile page. It serves as a clear brand indicator to a G2 user that they are viewing your product profile. A profile logo must be in the .jpg, .png, or .gif format, and it must be at least 400 pixels. To select a profile logo for your G2 product profile page, complete the following steps: 1. Go to **Product Profile** > **Product Information** in my.G2. 2. Under Profile Logo, select **Upload logo file**. 3. Choose the desired image file in your local storage. Only images that are the appropriate format and size should be available to upload. 4. The image file should upload and generate a preview. If the preview is not correct, select the trash can icon to delete the image file and attempt the upload process again. 5. Select **Save** at the bottom of the screen. Once the image file has been uploaded and saved, the profile logo should be added to your G2 product profile page immediately. ![myG2_ProductLogo](https://cdn.document360.io/1759d01c-b118-4f31-81f7-e4011071a6d4/Images/Documentation/myG2_ProductLogo.png)","{",'height="" width=""',"}","### Grid logo The Grid logo is used when your product appears in any G2 Grid layout. G2 Grids show how products compare to each other within the same product category. A Grid logo must be in the .svg format, and the file size must be smaller than 5 MB. :::(Info) Rather than use the same corporate logo style for both the Grid logo and profile logo, G2 recommends that a Grid logo avoid using text-based images. The small size of a Grid logo makes it difficult for your brand to stand out effectively for G2 users if it is text heavy. ::: To select a Grid logo for your G2 product, complete the following steps: 1. Go to **Product Profile** > **Product Information** in my.G2. 2. Under Grid Logo, select **Upload logo file**. 3. Choose the desired image file in your local storage. Only images that are the appropriate format and size should be available to upload. 4. The image file should upload and generate a preview. If the preview is not correct, select the trash can icon to delete the image file and attempt the upload process again. 5. Select **Save** at the bottom of the screen. Once the image file has been uploaded and saved, the Grid logo should be used whenever your product appears in a G2 Grid. To view a Grid, go to a G2 category page that includes your product. For example, the following image shows the G2 Grid for the Buyer Intent Data Tools category. ![myG2_GridLogo](https://cdn.document360.io/1759d01c-b118-4f31-81f7-e4011071a6d4/Images/Documentation/myG2_GridLogo.png)","{",'height="" width=""',"}","## Profile G2 Badge The Profile G2 Badge section is where you can choose which G2 Badge you want to display to buyers on your G2 product profile. For more information on G2 Badges, refer to the [G2 Badges](https://documentation.g2.com/g2/docs/g2-badges) documentation. ![g2 profile badge](https://cdn.document360.io/1759d01c-b118-4f31-81f7-e4011071a6d4/Images/Documentation/g2%20profile%20badge.png)","{",'height="" width=""',"}",":::(Warning) As your product earns new Badges, G2 automatically updates your profile Badge with one from the most recent reporting season. Selecting your own Badge in this section disables G2's automatic profile Badge update. If you opt to choose your own Badge, you must manually update your profile Badge as your product earns new Badges. ::: To manually select a Badge for your product profile, use the dropdown filters to choose a Badge from a specific reporting season. After making your selection, select **Save** to commit the changes to your G2 product profile. ![selecting-a-badge](https://cdn.document360.io/1759d01c-b118-4f31-81f7-e4011071a6d4/Images/Documentation/selecting-a-badge.gif)","{",'height="" width=""',"}","If you do not want a Badge to appear on your G2 profile, select **None** from the Select Badge dropdown. ## Profile banners The Profile Banners section is where you can choose an image to serve as the profile banner at the top of your G2 product profile page. You can also connect a video to your profile banner if you would like to make your branding more interactive for G2 users. ### Static image The profile banner appears across the top of your G2 product profile page. Along with the profile logo, it serves as a brand indicator to a G2 user that they are viewing your product profile. A profile banner must be in a .jpg, .png, or .gif format, and the file size must be smaller than 5 MB. The dimensions of the profile banner should be 1260 x 240 pixels. :::(Info) The profile logo covers the lower-left portion of the profile banner, and G2 badges might also be applied to the upper-right corner of the profile logo. You should choose a banner design that accounts for these restrictions. ::: To select a profile banner for your G2 product profile page, complete the following steps: 1. Go to **Product Profile** > **Product Information** in my.G2. 2. Under Grid Logo, select **Upload banner image**. 3. Choose the desired image file in your local storage. Only images that are the appropriate format and size should be available to upload. 4. The image file should upload and generate a preview. If the preview is not correct, select the trash can icon to delete the image file and attempt the upload process again. 5. Select **Save** at the bottom of the screen. Once the image file has been uploaded and saved, the profile banner should be added to your G2 product profile page immediately. ![myG2_ProfileBanner](https://cdn.document360.io/1759d01c-b118-4f31-81f7-e4011071a6d4/Images/Documentation/myG2_ProfileBanner.png)","{",'height="" width=""',"}","### Video In addition to the profile banner image, you can also connect a video to your profile banner. Use this option to provide G2 users with a video overview of your product or more product education. To do so, enter a video link from one of the following video-hosting services: YouTube, Wistia, Vidyard, or Vimeo. Then, select **Save**. :::(Info) Video links from alternative services are not accepted by G2. ::: Once the video has been connected, your G2 product profile page should update immediately with a large play icon in the middle of the profile banner. ![myG2_ProductInformation_Video](https://cdn.document360.io/1759d01c-b118-4f31-81f7-e4011071a6d4/Images/Documentation/myG2_ProductInformation_Video.png)","{",'height="" width=""',"}","## Profile details The Profile Details section is where you can better inform G2 users about your product. If possible, you should complete the following sections and ensure that they are updated in the future so potential buyers always have accurate information about your product. | Section | Details | | --- | --- | | What is [product name]? | Provide an overview of your product. This can include information about key features, the value you deliver to customers, and general background information about your product and company.

",(0,a.kt)("br",null),(0,a.kt)("br",null)," This section should not be used to indicate whether your customer support offers help in certain languages. | | External Community Link | If you have a community-oriented board where current and potential customers can exchange information, enter the link for it here.

Even if you enter a link here, the G2 discussions page option is still available at the top of your product profile page.| | How do you position yourself against your competitors? | Use this section to differentiate your product from your competitors. You can highlight key features or other unique aspects of your product. | | Software Type | Select ",(0,a.kt)("strong",null,"On Premises"),", ",(0,a.kt)("strong",null,"Hosted (in the cloud)"),", or ",(0,a.kt)("strong",null,"both"),".
