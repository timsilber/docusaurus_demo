Screenshots and other information included in this documentation do not reflect G2\u2019s actual pricing or package structure. ::: To add pricing and package information to your product profile, complete the following steps: 1. In the my.G2 Packages & Pricing tab, select **Add pricing package**. 2. Enter the relevant details for the package, and then select **Save**. 3. Repeat steps 1-2 to add more packages to your product profile. You can choose different pricing options for each package that you add, but G2 recommends standardizing your pricing structure for all packages so buyers can more easily compare the provided options. Packages are automatically arranged according to the pricing details you add for each package. To rearrange the order of your packages, scroll over a package and then select-and-drag the package to the desired spot. ![PackagesPricing_RearrangePackages](https://cdn.document360.io/1759d01c-b118-4f31-81f7-e4011071a6d4/Images/Documentation/PackagesPricing_RearrangePackages.gif)","{",'height="50%" width="50%"',"}","4. (Optional) In the **Basic Details** section, enter details including the pricing description and whether a free trial is available for your product. 5. (Optional) If your pricing and package information is more complicated, or you prefer to provide your organization\u2019s standard pricing list, select **Upload pricing list** and choose a supported PDF from your local machine. If the file is larger than 5MB, an error message informs you to upload a smaller file. 6. Select **Save**. 7. Go to your **Pricing** section of your product profile page on G2.com and confirm that all information is accurate. To better understand the options that are available to you in the Packages & Pricing tab, review the information in the following table, and then expand the image to see where each section in my.G2 appears in the G2.com product profile page: | Image number | my.G2 section | Description | | --- | --- | --- | | 1 | Edition Name | Enter the name of each package that you add to your profile. For example, you could have Basic, Advanced, and Enterprise editions of your product. | | 2 | Edition Description | Enter a description of each package. Use the description to inform buyers about what is included in each package and the type of customer that might be interested in them. | | 3 | Do you offer the edition by a unit such as a user, seat, or license? | If a package includes a certain number of users or licenses, describe that pricing structure. | | 4 | How often do you bill for your product? | If your organization expects to be paid at regular cadences for the package, select the appropriate option from the dropdown. | | 5 | Price | Two options are available in this section:",(0,a.kt)("br",null),(0,a.kt)("br",null)," 1. Add a price for the package, including a standard currency.

Select one of the options from **Free Trial**, **Contact Us**, or **Pay As You Go** to use a CTA button instead of a price. When a Buyer selects one of these buttons, they will be prompted to complete your lead form. To change your lead form, go to my.G2 and select the **Buyer Activity** > **Leads** > **Lead Form** tab. | | 6 | Select a CTA type | If you want to add both pricing and a CTA button (number 5), select one of the CTA options. Do not use this option if you already chose a CTA button instead of adding a price. | | 7 | Add Feature | Enter specific features that are included in each of your packages. Select **Add Feature** to add more features to your package description. | | 8 | Pricing Description | Add information that provides context to your pricing and packages. For example, you could explain the types of users that are typically interested in your product. | | 9 | Footer | Add a footer to provide disclaimer information related to your pricing and packages. | | 10 | Free Trial Available? | Select **Yes** if you want to add an indicator confirming to buyers that they can trial your product before purchasing it. | | 11 | Complete Pricing List | If your pricing and package information is more complicated, or you prefer to provide your organization\u2019s standard pricing list, you can choose to upload a PDF of your pricing and package structure.
