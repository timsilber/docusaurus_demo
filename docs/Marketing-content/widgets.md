  </div>
  For more information on the inclusion criteria, scoring, and the quadrants and axes of a Grid<sup>®</sup>, review G2’s [Research Scoring Methodologies](https://research.g2.com/methodology/scoring#satisfaction-rating).
  :::(Info)
  You can dedicate a specific logo to represent your product on Grid<sup>®</sup> widget in [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/product_information). For more detailed guidelines on adding a custom logo to Grid<sup>®</sup> widget, refer to G2’s [Product Profile](https://documentation.g2.com/docs/product-information#grid-logo) documentation.
  :::
  ### Live Category Grid™ widgets: Viewing, modifying, and embedding
  A Live Category Grid™ is generated for your product according to G2’s [standards for inclusion in reports.](https://research.g2.com/methodology/scoring#satisfaction-rating) If your product is included in multiple categories, a unique Grid<sup>®</sup> will be generated for each category in which your product meets the inclusion criteria.
  <center><div style={{width: 450}}><iframe src="https://www.g2.com/categories/buyer-intent-data-tools/grids.embed?filters%5Bcompany_segment%5D=&wid=1641918551" id="g2-crowdwidget-default" width="400px" height="400px" frameBorder={0} scrolling="no" style={{width: '100%', minHeight: '100%', overflow: 'hidden'}}> </iframe> <a href="https://www.g2.com/categories/buyer-intent-data-tools" style={{fontSize: 12, color: '#515159', fontWeight: 600}}>    G2 Grid® for Buyer Intent Data Tools</a> </div></center><br />
  To view and modify the embed code for your Live Category Grid™:
  1. In [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/widgets/grid_widgets), go to **Marketing Content** &gt; **Widgets** &gt; **Grid<sup>®</sup> Widget**. All of your available grids are displayed in the **Live Category Grid Widgets** section. 
  2. Select the **edit** **icon** in the top-right corner of the Grid<sup>®</sup> you want to embed or modify.
  3. You will be presented with a customization card containing a preview of your Grid<sup>®</sup>, as well as several modifiable options:
  **Size:** Modifying this dropdown alters the amount of space the Grid<sup>®</sup> occupies on your website. 
  **Segment:** Modifying this field will display your product’s performance based on the company size of your reviewers. By default, this field is set to **All**. You might choose to modify this field if your product performs better within a specific market segment (Small Business, Mid-Market, or Enterprise). 
  :::(Warning)
  Your product must meet the [inclusion criteria](https://research.g2.com/methodology/scoring#satisfaction-rating) for a specific Segment (Small Business, Mid-Market, or Enterprise) in order to be included in the Grid<sup>®</sup> for that Segment. As a result, G2 recommends verifying that your product’s logo appears on the Grid<sup>®</sup> for your chosen Segment before embedding it on your website.
  ::: 
  4. Select **Copy embed code**, and then paste the embed code into your chosen location. This could be the source code of your organization’s website, a landing page built in HubSpot or Marketo, or any other location that supports HTML embeds.
  :::(Warning)
  Because this is a live Grid<sup>®</sup>, your product’s position in the Grid<sup>®</sup> changes based on new G2 reviews. Additionally, Grid<sup>®</sup> widgets are interactive -- both your product logo and those of your competitors are selectable and link to the G2 reviews page for the corresponding product. 
  :::
  ### Report-based Grid™ widgets: Viewing, modifying, and embedding
  G2 automatically generates a Report-based Grid™ for your product if it is included in a G2 [Market Report](https://my.g2.com/~/reports_library). For more information on the inclusion criteria, scoring, and the quadrants and axes of a Grid<sup>®</sup>, check out G2’s [Market Presence Scoring](https://research.g2.com/methodology/scoring#satisfaction-rating) guide.
  <center><div style={{width: 450}}><iframe src="https://www.g2.com/reports/47603877-3a5c-46ec-b43a-e2fb85e1b51f/products/g2-seller-solutions/grid.embed" id="g2-crowd-widget-default" width="400px" height="400px" frameBorder={0} scrolling="no" style={{width: '100%', minHeight: '100%', overflow: 'hidden'}}> </iframe> <a href="https://www.g2.com/reports/grid-report-for-buyer-intent-data-tools-winter-2022?secure%5Bproduct_slug%5D=g2-seller-solutions&secure%5Breport_uuid%5D=47603877-3a5c-46ec-b43a-e2fb85e1b51f&secure%5Btoken%5D=043f77b9041a8b45255c491ebb739486562c1a7a03d8d1606ef56f72ccf334d5" style={{fontSize: 12, color: '#515159', fontWeight: 600}}>    G2 Grid® for Buyer Intent Data Tools  | Winter 2022 </a> </div></center><br />
  To view and modify the embed codes for your Report-based Grids™:
  1. In [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/widgets/grid_widgets), go to **Marketing Content** &gt; **Widgets** &gt; **Grid<sup>®</sup>  Widget**, then scroll to **Quarterly Report Grid Widgets**.
  2. View the available Report-based Grids™ by selecting the **Report** dropdown. Adjust the **Size** dropdown to change the amount of space the Grid<sup>®</sup> occupies on your website.
  3. Select **Copy embed code**, and then paste the embed code into your chosen location. This could be the source code of your organization’s website, a landing page built in HubSpot or Marketo, or any other location that supports HTML embeds.
  :::(Warning)
  Unlike Live Category Grid**™** widgets, Report-based Grid**™** widgets are tied to a specific report and do not change with new reviews. G2 recommends updating your Report-based Grid**™** widgets quarterly to reflect new Market Reports. 
  Grid<sup>®</sup> widgets are interactive--both your product logo and the placeholders for the logos of your competitors are selectable and link to the G2 reviews page for the corresponding product.

  ## Star Rating widget
  ***
  Star Rating widget provides a way to use your website, landing pages, sidebars, and email signatures to generate and showcase your G2 reviews. Star Rating widget can also supplement your SEO initiatives and increase your click-through rate (CTR) by displaying the G2 star rating for your products in search engine results.
  There are two types of Star Rating widgets:
  <div className="row">
    <div className="column left" style={{alignItems: 'center'}}>
      <center><a href="https://www.g2.com/products/g2-seller-solutions/reviews?utm_source=review-widget" title="Read reviews of G2 Marketing Solutions on G2"><img className="full-width" style={{maxWidth: 300}} alt="Read G2 Marketing Solutions reviews on G2" src="https://www.g2.com/products/g2-seller-solutions/widgets/stars?color=white&type=read" /></a></center><br />
      <center><h3>Read our Reviews</h3></center>
      <p>This widget links to your G2 product profile, where users can read your current reviews</p>
    </div>
    <div className="column right" style={{alignItems: 'center'}}>
      <center><a href="https://www.g2.com/products/g2-seller-solutions/take_survey?utm_source=review-widget" title="Write a review of G2 Marketing Solutions on G2"><img className="full-width" style={{maxWidth: 300}} alt="Review G2 Marketing Solutions on G2" src="https://www.g2.com/products/g2-seller-solutions/widgets/stars?color=gray&type=reviews" /></a></center><br />
      <center><h3>Review us</h3></center>
      <p>This widget links directly to a new G2 review form for your product. In order to leave a review, users must create or sign in to their G2 account.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <br /><br />
  ### Adding Star Rating widget to your website
  1. In [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/widgets/star_rating_widgets), go to **Marketing Content** &gt; **Widgets** &gt; **Star Rating Widget**. 
  3. Choose a widget type and style. 
  4. Select **Copy embed code**, and then paste the embed code into your chosen location. This could be the source code of your organization’s website, a landing page built in HubSpot or Marketo, or any other location that supports HTML and Javascript embeds.
  :::(Warning)
  While Star Rating widget can be added to multiple webpages, G2 does not recommend adding it to every page of your website. Most vendors add Star Rating widget to their most popular pages, such as the homepage or the product information page of their website, which drives the greatest impact in terms of user engagement. 
  :::
  ### Adding Star Rating widget to email signatures
  If your email client or signature software supports HTML code in email signatures, follow the same steps for **Adding Star Rating widget to your website**, but paste the copied embed code into the relevant section of your email client or software.
  :::(Info)
  Create unique custom signatures for different roles around your company using Star Rating widgets. 
  For example, your Account Managers can place the “Review us” widget in their email signatures to drive more G2 reviews, while your Sales team can use the “Read our reviews” widget to direct potential customers to the reviews on your G2 product profile.
  :::
  If you do not have an option to render HTML code in email signatures, you can achieve the same effect by completing the following steps:
  1. In [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/widgets/star_rating_widgets), go to **Marketing Content** &gt; **Widgets** &gt; **Star Rating Widget**. 
  2. Right-select the image for the widget version you would like to use, then save the image to your local device.
  3. Extract the URL from the embed code of the widget by copying the URL in quotes following the href attribute (&lt;a href= ”**[your URL]**“). 
  ![copy href star rating widget](https://cdn.document360.io/1759d01c-b118-4f31-81f7-e4011071a6d4/Images/Documentation/copy%20href%20star%20rating%20widget.gif){'{'}height="" width=""{'}'}
  4. In your email client, upload the saved image from step 2 to your custom signature. 
  5. Apply the URL from step 3 to your image. 
  :::(Info)
  If using Gmail, this can be accomplished by first highlighting the image, then selecting the **link** **icon** to display a link dialog box. Paste your URL into the specified box, then select **OK**.
  :::
  8. Save the signature.
  9. Send a test email and confirm that Star Rating widget appears in your signature.
  ### Enabling star ratings in search engine results
  Search engines can display aggregate ratings for your products, including visual stars, review scores, and number of reviews. Adding Star Rating widget to your website can improve the styling and page rank of your landing page in search engines without requiring your developers to add and maintain schema markup. 
  ![star ratings in search results](https://cdn.document360.io/1759d01c-b118-4f31-81f7-e4011071a6d4/Images/Documentation/star%20ratings%20in%20search%20results.png){'{'}height="" width=""{'}'}
  :::(Warning)
  G2 does not recommend enabling this feature if you have existing Product Review schema markup on your website, including if you use G2 Badges to display star ratings in search results. 
  :::
  To enable G2 star ratings in search engines:
  1. In [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/badges), go to **Marketing Content** &gt; **G2 Badges**.
  2. Move the **Include star rating on Google search results** slider to the **ON** position.
  3. Embed your G2 Badge on the relevant product pages of your website.
  :::(Info) 
  If your organization has a single product, G2 recommends placing Star Rating widget in the footer of your website to apply Product Review schema to all pages on your website. 
  If your organization has multiple products, you should place a product-specific Star Rating widget for each product page on your website instead of using the footer. This measure helps maintain the accuracy of G2 star ratings in search results.
  :::
  From the time this feature is first enabled, search engines can take between two weeks and three months to include G2 star ratings in search results. 
  :::(Warning)
  While enabling star ratings in search engines makes your webpages eligible for enhanced appearance in internet searches, it does not guarantee that the stars will appear for all keyword searches. Many factors determine whether a search engine shows stars for a search. For more information, review the schema markup guidelines for the search engine you are targeting.
