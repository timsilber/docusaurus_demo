Up to six images can be uploaded to this section. Each image must be smaller than 5MB, and be one of the following support file types: .jpg, .png, or .gif.

If you upload an animated .gif, buyers can only see the animated version when they open the file.

## Content syndication
By default, the screenshots you upload to your product profile are made available in marketplaces that contractually syndicate G2's content. Content syndication saves you the time of maintaining product profiles in other marketplaces by enabling buyers to interact with the content that you have already uploaded to G2.

Any time you upload a new screenshot for your G2 product profile, the content will update on non-G2 marketplaces within 30 days.

If you want to remove your screenshots from non-G2 marketplaces, uncheck the content syndication permissions checkbox and then select **Save**. It can take up to 30 days for your content to be removed.
