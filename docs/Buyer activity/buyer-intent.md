# Buyer Intent

G2 Buyer Intent captures enriched data about buyers researching your product across G2. Buyer Intent signals are triggered by a variety of actions, including interacting with your product profile page, comparing your product to a competitor, or viewing alternatives to a product in a shared G2 product category. This data enables your sales, marketing, and customer success teams to identify where an organization is on their buyer journey.

:::(Info)
To discover which platforms can be used for building G2's Buyer Intent data into your existing platforms and workflows, refer to the [Integrations](https://documentation.g2.com/docs/about-g2-integrations) documentation.
:::

## Basics of G2 Buyer Intent

### Confirming your Buyer Intent signal access

Your product’s G2 plan determines the types of Buyer Intent signals you receive. You must be subscribed to at least the Pro plan to receive Buyer Intent signals from G2. 

:::(Info)
G2 sends Buyer Intent signals at the product level. If your organization has multiple G2-listed products, each product that you want to receive Buyer Intent signals must have its own subscription. For more information on switching between your products in my.G2, refer to the [Confirming product access](#confirming-product-access) section.
:::

To find the signals available with your current plan:

1. Go to [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/upgrade){target="_blank"}, then **Account** > **Upgrade**.
2. Your product’s plan is highlighted by a *CURRENT PLAN* banner. Refer to the *Buyer Intent* section of this table to confirm the signals your product receives.

![current subscription](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/BI-myG2-current-plan.jpg?raw=true)

:::(Info)
If you are interested in receiving more Buyer Intent signals than your current plan offers, please contact your G2 representative.
:::

### Confirming product access

G2 recommends verifying that your my.G2 account can access all G2-listed products relevant to your role. 

To verify the products you can access:

1. Go to [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/dashboard/home){target="_blank"}.
2. Open the product dropdown at the top of the page to reveal your my.G2 product access.

![access products](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/BI-myG2-check-products.gif?raw=true)

3. Confirm that your user account can access the necessary G2-listed products. To access products that are not listed in the dropdown, please ask a user in your organization with access to the missing product to invite you, or contact your G2 representative.

### Signal types

Each Buyer Intent signal represents a unique buyer interaction on G2. The following table describes the signals G2 offers. 

| Signal            | Description     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Product profile   | A buyer viewed your [G2 product profile](https://www.g2.com/products/g2-seller-solutions/reviews){target="_blank"}. <br /><br />This activity indicates that the buyer is specifically researching your product.                                |
| Alternatives      | A buyer viewed a G2 [alternatives page](https://www.g2.com/products/g2-seller-solutions/competitors/alternatives){target="_blank"} for your product or a competitor’s product. <br /><br />For alternatives pages featuring a competitor’s product, this activity can indicate that the buyer is seeking alternatives for a product in your category, but your product is not necessarily being compared directly. |
| Category          | A buyer viewed a G2 [category page](https://www.g2.com/categories/technology-review-platforms){target="_blank"} that includes your product. <br /><br />G2 categorizes products based on a number of factors, including similar functionality and use case.                                                                                                                                         |
| Compare           | A buyer viewed a G2 [comparison page](https://www.g2.com/compare/capterra-vs-g2-seller-solutions){target="_blank"} that included your product. <br /><br />This activity indicates the buyer is directly comparing your product to a competitor’s product.                                                                                                                                           |
| Sponsored content | A buyer viewed an advertisement for your product on G2.com. <br /><br />This signal includes the G2 page where your advertisement was loaded, such as on a competitor’s product profile or category page.                                                                                                                 |
| Licensed content  | A buyer viewed one of your licensed G2 reports. <br /><br />This activity indicates that a buyer is interacting with the licensed G2 content you have provided to them. For more information, refer to the [Report Library](https://documentation.g2.com/docs/report-library){target="_blank"} documentation.                                                                              |
| Reference page    | A buyer viewed one of your G2 [Reference pages](https://www.g2.com/products/g2-seller-solutions/references/2021-intent-data-references){target="_blank"}. <br /><br />This activity indicates that a buyer is interacting with the G2 content you have provided them. For more information, refer to the [Reference Pages](https://documentation.g2.com/docs/reference-pages){target="_blank"} documentation.                                                                                     |

:::(Warning)
Not all G2 plans receive Buyer Intent signals, and some plans receive more signals than others. For more information, refer to the [Confirming your Buyer Intent signal access](#confirming-your-g2-buyer-intent-signal-access) section.
::: 

### Buying Stage and Activity Level
G2 reports two unique scoring components, *Buying Stage* and *Activity Level*, for each of your buyers to provide a clear idea of where a buyer is on their journey and how to effectively engage them.

#### Buying Stage 
Buying Stage evaluates your buyer's journey across G2 by combining funnel-dependent factors such as page engagement and signal type. The following list includes a description of each Buying Stage and recommended actions.

| Buying Stage | Description | Recommended action|
| - | - | - |
| Awareness | The buyer is exploring how different products might address their needs, but is not likely to have an in-depth understanding of your product category. |  Supply general education materials about your product and attempt to gain an understanding of the buyer’s specific needs.|
| Consideration | The buyer is considering a product in your category, but has not defined a short list of products.| Demonstrate how your product can directly satisfy their requirements.|
| Decision | The buyer is ready to purchase a product. | Actively differentiate your product from your competitors.|

#### Activity Level 
Activity Level measures a buyer's general activity on G2 by aggregating buyer activity data, such as time spent per page and the number of signals generated. The following list includes a description of each Activity Level and recommended actions.

| Activity Level | Description | Recommended action|
| - | - | - |
| Low  |  The buyer is conducting preliminary research but is not yet ready to make a purchase. | Consider adding the buyer to a nurture campaign. |
| Medium | The buyer is actively researching your product. | Add the buyer to your outreach lists and engage them within a week. |
| High | The buyer is in the purchasing process.| Engage with the buyer immediately.|

:::(Warning)
As of June 2022, G2 reports Buying Stage and Activity Level in place of a singular Buyer Intent score. For more information on using Buying Stage and Activity Level to filter Buyer Intent data, refer to the [Filters](#filters) section.

G2 updates Buying Stage and Activity Level daily.
:::  

## Accessing G2 Buyer Intent data

To access Buyer Intent data for your product, go to [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/buyer_intent){target="_blank"}, then **Buyer Activity** > **Buyer Intent** > **Your signals**. 

![buyer intent tab](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/BI-myG2-buyer-intent-tab.png?raw=true)

G2 populates Buyer Intent data for your product based on the filter criteria in the *[Match Your Ideal Customer Profile](#setting-your-ideal-customer-profile-icp)* panel. You can view aggregate data about your buyers in the *[Buyer Engagement Highlights](#buyer-engagement-highlights)* panel, or explore the activity of individual buyer organizations using the *[View Buyer Intent Insights](#buyer-intent-insights)* table. 

### Setting your ideal customer profile (ICP)

Use the filters in the *Match Your Ideal Customer Profile* pane to refine the Buyer Intent data displayed. 

![ICP panel](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/BI-myG2-match-your-icp.png/?raw=true)

#### Filters

Buyer Intent filters enable you to efficiently target buyers based on your selected criteria, such as your product’s current ICP. 

:::(Info)
You can also use the [Firmographic Analytics](#firmographic-analytics) tab to learn more about which organizations are organically researching your product or category.
:::

G2 offers the following Buyer Intent data filters: 

* *Date Range*: Choose a default date range, or set a custom range. Custom date ranges cannot be longer than one year.
* *Companies*: Search for and select specific organizations to include or exclude.
* *Company Demographics*: Define firmographic information, such as market segment, company size, geographic region, or industry.
* *Product Categories*: If your product is included in multiple G2 categories, select the category signals you want to include or exclude using the dropdown. Alternative signals will also be included or excluded for their corresponding category.
* *Buyer Intent Score and Competitors*: Find organizations that generated specific signal types, are in a particular *Buying Stage*, or have a minimum *Activity Level*. You can also refine *Compare* signals by searching for specific competitors.

:::(Warning)
As of June 2022, G2 reports Buying Stage and Activity Level in place of a singular Buyer Intent score. For more information about these scoring components, refer to the [Buying Stage and Activity Level](#buying-stage-and-activity-level) section

G2 has automatically migrated your Buyer Intent scores to the new Activity Level scoring model, enabling you to use the Activity Level filter for historical signals.

Buying Stage is a net new scoring component. When using the Buying Stage filter, ensure that your date range accounts for the June 2022 release date.
:::  

#### Saved filters
Once your ICP filters are set, you can save your filter choice for later use. To create a new filter, select the **Create New Saved Filter **dropdown, enter a name for your filter, then select **Save**.

## Exporting Buyer Intent data

G2 provides two options for exporting your Buyer Intent data to CSV files: [CSV](#csv) and [Detail CSV](#detail-csv).

:::(Warning)
The data included in your CSV depends on the filters set in the *[Match Your Ideal Customer Profile](#setting-your-ideal-customer-profile-icp)* pane. Larger datasets take longer to generate CSVs.
:::

### CSV
Select **Download CSV** to export a CSV in which each row represents a buyer organization.

![csv](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/BI-myG2-CSV-updated.png?raw=true)

The CSV data resembles the information in the [Buyer Intent Insights](#buyer-intent-insights) table, including the headquarter location of the company, the number of pageviews per signal, the Buying Stage and Activity Level, and the date of the most recent Buyer Intent signal for your product. 

:::(Info)
The “direct_pageviews” column aggregates product profile and sponsored content pageviews to highlight the number of signals that do not feature competitor products.
:::

### Detail CSV
Select **Download Detail CSV** to export a CSV in which each row represents an individual Buyer Intent signal.  

![detail csv](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/BI-myG2-detail-csv.png?raw=true)
 
The Detail CSV data resembles the information on the [Detailed company activity](#detailed-company-activity) page, including specific information about each Buyer Intent signal, the geolocation of the individual buyer, and firmographic information about the buyer organization.

## G2 Stack
G2 Stack enhances the Buyer Intent signals you already receive from G2 by incorporating tech stack data to better inform your marketing and sales strategies.

:::(Info)
G2 Stack is only available to organizations that currently receive Buyer Intent data.

If you are interested in receiving Stack data, contact your G2 representative to learn more.
:::

Buyer Intent captures enriched data about buyers researching your product and competitors across G2.com, while Stack data identifies the specific software products that those buyers are already using.

G2 Stack enables you to gain insights about a buyer’s current software before reaching out. Use Stack data to empower your marketing and sales teams to:

* Understand a buyer’s use cases in advance so they can highlight your product’s strengths.
* Show how your product integrates with other products in a buyer’s tech stack.
* Personalize outreach messaging with distinctions between your product and a buyer’s current solution.

### Data sources
To identify the software products in a buyer organization’s tech stacks, G2 crawls the web and analyzes publicly available websites and code. G2’s proprietary crawling technology enables it to spot key indicators that help determine whether an organization uses certain products.

G2 does not scrape this information from sites. G2’s crawler collects relevant details directly from the source, meaning Stack data provides more accurate, actionable data than scrapers.

:::(Info)
G2 does not collect, process, or store any personally identifiable data for Stack. All data collected is organization-level information, which means GDPR and other data privacy legislation are not applicable for Stack customers.
:::

### Viewing Stack data in my.G2 and CSV downloads
To access your Stack data, go to [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/buyer_intent){target="_blank"}, then **Buyer Activity** > **Buyer Intent** > **Your Signals**.

*Most Common Stack Products* shows you which products appear most often across your Stack data. These figures adjust as you change the filter selections. For example, you can choose to exclude a certain product or product category from your Stack data.

![View the Stack products that come up most often for you](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/stack-mostcommonproducts.png?raw=true){height="80%" width="80%"}

In the View Buyer Intent Insights section, the *Stack Products* column displays the products in use by each buyer organization.

![View buyer tech stacks](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/stack-productscolumn.png?raw=true){height="80%" width="80%"}

To download your Stack data, select **Download CSV**. The "product_name" column details the tech stack for each buyer organization.

:::(Info)
Active filters impact the data that is included in your CSV file. Confirm your filter selections before downloading your Stack data.
:::

For more information about a buyer’s tech stack, select **See Details**. In the Buyer Intent Activity page, the *Stack Data* section provides the following details about the buyer’s stack.

| Stack Product | Product Domain | Product Category | Last Seen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The product the buyer is using. | The domain of the product being used. | The G2 product category of the product being used. | The most recent date the product was used, as confirmed by G2. |

![More Stack information](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/stack-moredata.jpg?raw=true){height="80%" width="80%"}

## Email notifications for Buyer Intent activity

Enable members of your organization, including those without my.G2 accounts, to use Buyer Intent data for discovering prospects or keeping track of existing accounts directly from their inbox. 

![example email](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/BI-myG2-notification-email-example.png?raw=true)

Buyer Intent email notifications are sent at a regular interval of your choice, and can be set for specific companies or companies that match your filter criteria.

![include or exclude account](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/BI-myG2-notification-account-filter.png?raw=true)

:::(Warning)
If using company domains, they must exactly match the company domain on the Buyer Intent signal. If using company names, partial matches are accepted.
:::

#### Filter by demographics

To include companies based on your ideal customer profile, add filters to the *Filter by demographics* panel. 

![firmographic notification filter](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/BI-myG2-notification-demographics-updated.gif?raw=true)

You can filter company headquarter locations by global region using the corresponding checkboxes, or add local region filters by selecting **Add another location**.

:::(Info)
Companies that meet any one of your location criteria will be included in your notification. 

Local region filters do not have to correspond to your global region filters. For example, using the **APAC** global region filter and a local region filter for **Illinois, United States** includes companies from either region in your notification.
:::

#### Filter by activity

Use the criteria in the *Filter by Organizational Activity* panel to find companies that generated specific signal types, are in a particular *Buying Stage*, or have a minimum *Activity Level*. You can also refine signals that include other products in your category, such as *Alternatives* and *Compare* pageviews, by searching for specific competitors.

![activity notification filter](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/BI-myG2-notification-new-score-activity-filter.png?raw=true)
