# Buyer Engagement score

The Buyer Engagement score provides recommended tasks to complete to ensure that you are engaging appropriately with potential buyers via G2. The Buyer Engagement score also measures your progress in completing those tasks. 

To raise your productâ€™s score and better engage with G2 buyers:

1. Go to [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/g2-seller-solutions/dashboard/home){target="_blank"} and select the Buyer Engagement score dropdown at the top of any my.G2 page.
2. There are two sections in the Buyer Engagement score:
    * **Profile Must Haves**: This section lists the to-do tasks for your product. Select any item in this section to go to the area in my.G2 where you can complete the task.
    * **Completed Tasks**: Select this dropdown to view the Buyer Engagement tasks that have already been completed for your product.

3. As you complete more tasks, your Buyer Engagement score improves. When all tasks are completed, the score is set to 100.
