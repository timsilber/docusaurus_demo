# Reference Pages

Reference Pages provide a simple way to highlight your favorite G2 reviews while crafting a shareable, branded web page that can be customized for your target audience. 

Reference Pages contain content associated with your G2 product profile, including [G2 Market Reports](https://my.g2.com/~/reports_library), [G2 reviews](https://my.g2.com/~/review_activity), and [Crowd Quotes](https://documentation.g2.com/docs/crowd-quotes). You can also add your organization’s marketing media, such as downloadable files and video embeds.

G2 hosts your Reference Pages on an isolated web page, which means you can display your product's reviews and other content in a space free of competitor products. 

:::(Info)
Use Reference Pages in your account-based marketing (ABM) campaigns by highlighting reviews from brand advocates in the same industry, region, or department as your prospects.

### Creating a Reference Page

You can create an unlimited number of unique Reference Pages. Each page is hosted by G2 and is assigned a publicly-accessible URL.

To create a Reference Page:



1. In [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/references), go to **Marketing Content** > **Reference Pages**.
2. Select **Add Reference Page** to access the **Create a Reference Page** editor.
3. Enter a **Reference Page Label**. This label should be named to help you quickly identify the contents or intended audience of the Reference Page. For example, "G2 References for mid-market APAC organizations."
4. Enter a **Page Title**. This title is public and appears at the top of your Reference Page, next to your product logo. 

:::(Warning)
The page title also acts as the slug to your Reference Page URL. If two Reference Pages are given the same title, G2 adds a unique ID to the end of the URL for the newer Reference Page.

5. Set your Reference Page content:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
<strong>Profile Banner</strong>
   </td>
   <td><br />If you have already <a href="https://documentation.g2.com/docs/product-information">set a product profile banner in my.G2</a>, it will auto-populate. To change an existing banner, select the banner image, then upload your new image when prompted. 
<p /><br />
Adding a link to <strong>Video URL</strong> will cause the linked video to begin playing when a user selects your banner image. Videos must be hosted on Youtube, Wistia, Vidyard, or Vimeo.
