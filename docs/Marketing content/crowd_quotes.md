# Crowd Quotes

Crowd Quotes provides a convenient way to supply your sales, marketing, and design teams with snippets of your G2 reviews. Use Crowd Quotes to build trust and improve your marketing campaigns by displaying rich-text reviews from real users of your products.

:::(Info)
G2 hosts a shareable web page of your Crowd Quotes. This enables you to easily distribute your review snippets to members of your team that do not need admin access to your product's my.G2 account.

## Creating Crowd Quotes
The Crowd Quotes creation tool offers an interactive experience for generating a repository of review snippets. Crowd Quotes can only be created in [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/snippets){target="_blank"}.

To create a repository of Crowd Quotes:

1. Go to [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/snippets){target="_blank"}, then **Marketing Content** > **Crowd Quotes**.
2. Select **Choose your first quote** to access the **Create a Crowd Quote** editor. If you have already set up Crowd Quotes, select **Add a quote** to access the editor.
3. Find a review by using the filter dropdowns, or enter keywords into the search bar to find reviews containing specific text, such as a product feature or the name of one of your competitors. By default, the most recently published reviews appear first.
4. Select and drag the text you want to display in your Crowd Quote. Upon releasing the highlighted selection, the tag manager will appear. Text selections cannot span across multiple questions.

5. Type your desired tag name into the search bar, then select the tag from the search result dropdown. If you do not want to add a tag, leave the search bar empty and then select **Save**.
6. The **Existing Quotes** sidebar will update to reflect your new Crowd Quote snippet and the tag you associated with it. From this sidebar, you can:
* Select the **X** next to a Crowd Quote to remove it from your repository.
* Select **Add Tag** to associate more tags with the Crowd Quote. 
* Select the **X** next to a tag to remove the tag from a specific Crowd Quote.
7. Repeat this process for each review you want to add to your Crowd Quote repository. Select **Done** when you are finished creating Crowd Quotes.

:::(Warning)
Crowd Quotes cannot be modified after creation. To delete a Crowd Quote, go to [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/dashboard/home), then **Marketing Content** > **Crowd Quotes**. Select the **trash can icon** next to the Crowd Quote you want to delete.

### Creating multiple Crowd Quotes from a single review 
You might want to generate multiple Crowd Quotes from the same G2 review. The **Create a Crowd Quote** editor tracks the number of Crowd Quotes generated for each question within a specific review. 


#### Multiple Crowd Quotes from a single question
The total number of Crowd Quotes created from a specific question is represented by a number flag preceding the response.

![crowdquotes-onequestionmultiplequotes](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/crowdquotes-onequestionmultiplequotes.gif?raw=true){height="" width=""}

The *Existing Quotes* sidebar displays your Crowd Quotes in the order they were created. 

#### Multiple Crowd Quotes from multiple questions
If you create multiple Crowd Quotes from multiple questions within a single review, the counter resets for each question. Crowd Quotes across multiple questions display in the same order that questions are represented on the response form.
