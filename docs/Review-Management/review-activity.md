# Review Activity

The Review Activity page helps you monitor, analyze, and respond to your product’s G2 reviews directly from my.G2. Review Activity enables you to find reviews and take action, from setting up email notifications to using review filters.

![Overview of Review Activity page](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/reviewactivity-overview.jpg?raw=true){height="" width=""}

## Setting review notifications
To set up email notifications for new reviews that G2 has approved:

1. Select the **email settings** icon.
2. Confirm your email address is correct.
3. Choose how often you would like to be notified.
4. Select **Save**.

![Set up a G2 review notification](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/reviewactivity-notificationsetup.gif?raw=true){height="" width=""}

Email notifications can only be set for the product you are currently viewing in my.G2. If your organization has multiple G2-listed products, use the product dropdown to switch between products, then set up a new email notification.

## Responding to G2 reviews
Select **Read review** to view an entire review.

G2 recommends responding to positive and negative reviews to show buyers that you take customer feedback seriously. Responses are labeled with your name and organization, and are published below the corresponding review on G2.com.

To better respond to product feedback, you can also provide a link to a resource as part of your response. The link text is standardized to 'See how < your-product-name > improved.'

Select **Preview** to view your response's appearance when live, then select **Post Response** to publish your reply to G2.com. 

After submitting a response, a chat icon appears next to **Read review** for that review. If you open a review that you already responded to, you can edit or delete the response.

## Downloading review data
The date range and other [filters](/g2/docs/review-activity#filters) that you select for this page change the reviews that are included in the downloaded CSV.

Select **Download CSV** to download your product's G2 review data. The CSV contains the same information as the table in the Review Activity page.

## Sorting reviews

### Read/Unread

![Read and unread filter](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/reviewactivity-unread.gif?raw=true){height="" width=""}

Reviews can be filtered by their read status. While using the default **All** view, you can see how many of your product’s reviews are unread. The number of unread reviews changes in response to your review filters.

![Unread reviews count](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/reviewactivity-unreadcount.png?raw=true){height="" width=""}

To find the reviews that your organization has not read, select **Unread**.

### Scoring filters

![Filter reviews in various ways](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/reviewactivity-scoringfilters.png?raw=true){height="30%" width="30%"}
