  # Custom Questions
  Custom questions offer you the opportunity to ask questions about your products that are not included in the standard G2 review form. Use the insights from the responses to custom questions to better inform your organization’s product strategy and marketing content.
  :::(Info)
  Responses to custom questions are not made public and will not appear in the reviews displayed on your G2 product profile page.
  :::
  Custom questions are added before the Terms of Use questions in the G2 review form. With this placement, your custom questions are guaranteed to appear before a reviewer can submit the form.

  ## Create custom questions
  You can add up to two custom questions to the review form for each of your organization’s G2-listed products. Your questions can either be in a free-text or multiple choice format. For each multiple choice question added, you must also provide a list of answers that reviewers can choose from.
  Contact your G2 customer success manager to add custom questions to your product’s G2 review form.
  :::(Info)
  Reviewers are not required to enter answers for custom questions before submitting the review form.

  ### Example custom questions
  With custom questions, you can learn more about the features that are most important to your users, their unique use cases for your product, or which onboarding resources helped them the most. 
  The following questions and answers can serve as examples of the information that your organization can collect:

  :::(Warning)
  Your custom questions should not include the following details:
  * Any questions that seek to collect what could be considered personally identifiable information (PII)
  * References to other companies besides G2
  * Duplicates of questions that already appear in the G2 review form
