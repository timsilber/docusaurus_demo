References from Reviews enables you to easily connect with reviewers who agree to be a reference for your product. Use this page to access the contact information for your references to provide to prospects, or to discuss future advertising and promotional opportunities with your references directly.

To find your references, go to [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/customer_references), then **Review Management** > **References from Reviews**. You can modify the date range to find references from a specific time period.

### Contacting references

G2 offers two ways to contact references: via the G2 community or directly via email. Depending on whether your reference will be contacted by you or one of your prospects, you might choose one option over the other. 

For example, you might opt for G2 to mediate the initial communication with references in order to add context to contact requests or avoid email spam filters.  Alternatively, if your prospect does not have a G2 account, they are unable to access user profiles on G2.com, and you might choose to provide them with the reference’s business email address.

:::(Warning)
You should only contact a user via their G2 profile if they have agreed to be a reference for your product.

#### Contacting references via G2

To contact a reference via their G2 profile:

1. Go to [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/customer_references), then **Review Management** > **References from Reviews**.
2. Find the reference you want to contact. You might need to modify the date range to find a particular reference.
3. Select the reference’s **profile photo** to go to their G2 profile. 

:::(Info)
If you want G2 to mediate communication between your prospect and your reference, you can send your reference’s G2 profile URL directly to your prospect. Your prospect must have a G2 account to contact the reference via this channel.

4. Select **Contact User**, then fill out and submit the *User Contact Request* form. You will receive a confirmation email from G2 regarding your contact request within 24 hours.
