  # Review Campaigns
  G2 Review Campaigns help you collect reviews from your users by leveraging the experience of G2’s campaign specialists. Use G2 Review Campaigns to generate a stream of new reviews in order to inspire trust from buyers, improve your category ranking, and help your product qualify for inclusion in G2’s [Market Reports](https://my.g2.com/~/reports_library) and [Best Software Reports](https://www.g2.com/best-software-companies). 
  :::(Info)
  For more information on the inclusion criteria and scoring for Market Reports and Best of Lists, refer to G2’s [Research Scoring Methodologies](https://research.g2.com/methodology/scoring) guide.
  :::
  Each G2 Review Campaign consists of a standardized three-email sequence that features your product logo, describes your chosen incentive, and links to a branded review-collection landing page. Once a user leaves a review, they are unsubscribed from the remaining campaign emails. 
  :::(Info)
  The **Write a Review** button in the following example links to a landing page for a G2 Marketing Solutions example review campaign. Your product logo will be displayed instead of G2's logo when your campaign is live.
