  # Basics of in-app review prompts
  In-app review prompts make it easier for reviewers to submit reviews to G2.com, and eliminates the requirement that vendors supply G2 with customer email lists to fuel Review Campaigns. This is accomplished by linking directly to the G2 review process from a vendor’s website and removing the need for a reviewer to log in at G2.com.
  :::(Warning)
  Only non-incentivized reviews can be submitted via in-app review prompts. Gift cards or other incentives cannot be attached to this G2 review process.
  G2 values authentic and transparent feedback, which means collecting reviews of all types (negative, neutral, and positive alike). Per the [G2 Community Guidelines](https://www.g2.com/static/community_guidelines), a seller cannot segment reviewers to solicit only positive reviews. 
  :::
  If a user that is logged in to your website interacts with an in-app review prompt, their email address is securely passed to G2 and they are redirected to the review form for the product.
  If the user already has a G2.com account that matches the log-in credentials, the review that is submitted can be found on their G2 user profile page. If a matching G2.com account is not found, the review is still submitted using the provided email address. If a user later creates a G2 account with the same email address, the review will be attached to their account.
  G2 does not create accounts for users that submit a review via this method.
  :::(Info)
  If a user successfully submits a review, then returns to the survey at a later time, they will not be able to submit a new review. Instead, G2 presents them with their original response and allows them to update their review.

  ## Reviewer benefits
  With this experience, a user visiting your website can submit a review directly to G2.com. This removes the need to create a G2.com account or use G2’s social login options to submit a review. The reviewer can also still choose to submit the review as an anonymous user if they do not want their name attached to the review.
  This process also streamlines the effort to access a G2 review form, meaning users spend less time clicking around G2.com to start the review process.
  ## Vendor benefits
  In-app review prompts enable you to generate more reviews from product users directly from your own website. Remove the friction created by directing product users to G2.com’s account creation process as part of a Review Campaign, and improve the likelihood that a user will complete the review process.
  Security-focused organizations can better generate reviews without sharing user lists to G2 to conduct Review Campaigns.
  Collecting more, high-quality reviews also means that your products are more likely to be highlighted in one of G2’s “Best Of” lists or other quarterly reports. Review [Research Scoring Methodologies](https://research.g2.com/g2-scoring-methodologies) to better understand how G2 reviews impact those lists and reports.
  ## GDPR compliance
  This integration is GDPR compliant. G2 does not store email addresses for communication purposes, and reviewers must explicitly opt into G2’s [Terms of Use](https://www.g2.com/static/terms) before submitting a review through this integration. 
  The data passed to this integration is covered by the [master service agreement (MSA)](https://www.g2.com/legal/master-service-agreement){'{'}target="_blank"{'}'} and [data processing addendum (DPA)](https://www.g2.com/legal/data_processing_addendum){'{'}target="_blank"{'}'} your organization signed upon activating your G2 subscription.
  ## Standard G2 review form and quality
  The in-app review prompt experience does not negatively impact the quality of G2.com reviews. When a review is submitted via this process, the review undergoes the same manual moderation process as any other review submitted to G2.com.
  The review process that users are prompted to complete also asks the same questions as a standard G2 review form. If you want to add your own questions to the review form, review [Custom Questions](/g2/docs/custom-questions).

  ## Tracking reviews generated via in-app prompts
  To monitor the success of in-app prompts in generating G2 reviews, complete the following steps:
  1. Go to my.G2.com and log in.
  2. Go to the **Review Management** &gt; **Review Activity** tab.
  3. Select **Collected via review API** from the Review Source drop-down to filter reviews by sourced type.
  As in-app prompts utilize the G2 review API, this filtered view of your reviews should indicate whether your product users are submitting reviews via this process.
  :::(Info)
  Your organization might have other review generation efforts in place that use the G2 API, which might mean not every review displayed in this filtered review is the result of in-app prompts.
