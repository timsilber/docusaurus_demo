While the actual review process is still managed by G2, you need to build the prompt experience into your websites.

### Language
You must add language that informs the user that certain information will be shared with G2 to complete a review. This language can be placed adjacent to a call-to-action (CTA) button or text link.

The following language can be used as an example of user messaging:

* *To continue, [**Vendor Name**] will share your full name and email address with G2. Before choosing to submit a review, you can review G2’s[ Privacy Policy](https://www.g2.com/static/privacy) and[ Terms of Use](https://www.g2.com/static/terms).*

The language used to prompt a user to submit a G2 review should not influence the reviewer’s attitudes towards the vendor’s products. Refer to G2’s [Community Guidelines](https://www.g2.com/static/community_guidelines){target="_blank"} for more information on review collection standards.

### Locations
In-app review prompts can be placed practically anywhere on a website. The same G2 API information can also be used to place prompts across multiple website locations.

Potential locations where a prompt could appear include, but are not limited to:

| Potential locations | Logic |
| --- | --- |
| User profile menu | A user needs to be logged in to your website to proceed with the G2 review process, so place a review prompt in the same area as the user log-in experience to improve the likelihood a user will be signed in to complete the review. |
| Success page | If a user has achieved a desired outcome with your product, place a review prompt in the success page. |
| Time of active use | Deliver a prompt as part of the general user log-in experience when a certain period has passed. For example, when the user first logged in 30/60/90 days ago. |
| Action-oriented prompts | Insert a prompt when a user has completed a certain action in the product. For example, a prompt can be triggered at the end of an action that is associated with an advanced user. This can generate more G2 reviews from your most knowledgeable users. |
| Home page | Make a prompt visible on a website home page to drive more G2 reviews. However, this could frustrate users that are not logged in to your website. |
| User groups/communities | If you host a community where users can deliver feedback or answer each others’ questions, placing an in-app review prompt here can help target the most passionate users of a product. |

### Appearance
G2 does not control the appearance of an in-app review prompt, so you can utilize different color schemes and shapes when creating a prompt. For example, a prompt can be a typical call-to-action (CTA) according to your own website guidelines.
