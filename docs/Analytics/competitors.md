# Competitors

The Competitors tab helps you understand your performance on G2 by reporting the key factors influencing your product’s G2 Score alongside the same data for up to five of your competitors.

:::(Info)
Your G2 Score affects your product’s placement on G2 Grid<sup>®</sup>, inclusion in G2 Reports, and ranking in G2 categories.  For more information, refer to the [Research Scoring Methodologies](https://research.g2.com/methodology/scoring).

To access the Competitors tab, go to [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/competitors), then **Analytics** > **Competitors**. 

## Setting competitors

:::(Warning)
You should choose competitors that share at least one G2 category with your product. G2 does not report competitor data for products outside of a shared category.

## Viewing your Grid<sup>®</sup> placement 

G2 recommends using the Grid<sup>®</sup> preview to evaluate the impact of a [Review Campaign](https://documentation.g2.com/docs/review-campaigns) or to check your position before a new Market Report is released. 

You can switch between Grids<sup>®</sup> using the category and market segment filters.

To compare how your product’s Grid<sup>®</sup> placement has changed over time, use the report filter.

## Analyzing review trends

The *Review Trends* panel monitors the total number of reviews your product received in the past six months and compares your performance to your competitors.

:::(Info)
Percentages and directional arrows indicate the change in review volume relative to the previous six month interval.

## Market Presence and Satisfaction scores

G2 also reports the key data points used to calculate your Market Presence and Satisfaction scores, enabling you to understand and act on your category and Grid<sup>®</sup> placement. 

Use the dropdown in the *G2 Grid<sup>®</sup> Analytics* panel to view your Market Presence and Satisfaction scores for each category that includes your product.
