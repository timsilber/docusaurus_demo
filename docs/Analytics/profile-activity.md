# Profile Activity




  The Profile Activity page collects several types of traffic analytics measuring your productâ€™s performance on G2, enabling you to track activity changes over time and compare your traffic to your competitors.  
  ![demo](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/profileactivity-overview.gif?raw=true)
  ## Viewing your G2 activity
  To view your traffic data, go to [my.G2](https://my.g2.com/~/traffic_analytics), then **Analytics** &gt; **Profile Activity**. Traffic is displayed based on your selected timeframe. Select a default option, or enter a **Custom** date range. 
  ![choose dates](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/profileactivity-custom-date-range.gif?raw=true)
  Directional arrows and adjacent percentages indicate how your traffic has changed over time.

    <img style={{maxWidth: '70%', filter: 'none !important'}} src="https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/profileactivity-traffic-decrease.png?raw=true" />
  </div>
  :::(Info)
  The percent change is relative to the timeframe you select. For example, if you select a 30-day timeframe, G2 compares the traffic for the current 30-day interval to the previous 30-day interval. 
  If you select a custom timeframe, G2 calculates the number of days in your timeframe, then compares your timeframe to the same interval preceding your start date.
  :::
  To quickly access the traffic data from the previous interval, hover your cursor over the percentage.
  ![last period data](https://github.com/g2-documentation/images/blob/main/profileactivity-last-period.gif?raw=true)
  G2 plots your traffic on a graph and displays the data collected during each calendar week within your interval. Hover over a data point to reveal the traffic for the corresponding week.
